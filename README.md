Starting November 1, 2024, many men in Russia became automatically prohibited from leaving the country because they avoided being drafted into the military.

Built upon a Python DDoSing script from [MatrixTM/MHDDoS](https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS), this fork proposes more fine-tuning to engage in digital warfare against the state, more specifically in the context of military conscription — especially for attacking traffic redistribution systems related to cross-agency data transfers. Many state agencies rely on primitive mitigation methods and encryption practices, as proven numerous times through data leaks.
